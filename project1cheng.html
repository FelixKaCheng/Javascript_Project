    <div id="div2"><p>This Japanese Lorem Ipsum is based on the kanji frequency count at tidraso.co.uk and includes about 50% kanji, 25% hiragana, 20% katakana and 5% roman numerals and punctuation. Katakana and hiragana cluster in strings between 1 to 4 chars at random points in each paragraph. Hiragana occurs more often at the end of sentences, rather in clumps of 1 to 4 chars rather than just single chars. Katakana is very unlikely to appear as a single character in Japanese text, but hiragana could. Exclamation and question marks are "double-byte", not standard ascii ones. Suggestions for improvements or alternatives are welcome.</p></div>

    <div id="div4"><p>Greek Lorem Ipsum is a transliteration of the (pseudo) Latin original, eg b => β, L => Λ, D => Δ etc. Please cf. the Wikipedia page for the romanization of Greek. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.</p></div>

<h3>Tres</h3></div>
    <div id="div6"><p>Georgian Lorem Ipsum is a transliteration of the (pseudo) Latin original, eg a => ა, b => ბ, g => გ etc. without capitalisation as is usual in Georgian script. Also, no digraphs, only one latin letter per Georgian letter. Please cf. the Wikipedia page for the romanization of Russian script. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.</p></div>
